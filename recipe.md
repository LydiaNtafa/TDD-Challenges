# Function Design Recipe

## 1. Describe the Problem
Put or write the user story here. Add any clarifying notes you might have.

## 2. Design the Function Signature
Include the name of the function, its parameters, return value, and side effects.
Name:
Funcitonality:
Parameters: (list all parameters and their types)
Returns: (state the return value and its type)

Side effects: (state any side effects)

## 3. Create Examples as Tests
Make a list of examples of what the function will take and return.


## 4. Implement the Behaviour
After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour.

!! Ensure all test function names are unique, otherwise pytest will ignore them !!
